# MIS376--Covid_Impact_On_Airport_Traffic
  The dataset which shows Airport traffic around the world as a Percentage of the Traffic volume during the Covid-19 period.  I think that the traffic rate is really heavy because of the pandemic.


# Introduction

  Since the Covid-19 outbreak first emerged, it has greatly affected the world in every aspect of our lives. In order to slow down and stop the epidemic, many countries have issued travel restrictions, social distancing, or total closure orders, and so many businesses and operators have been affected. The travel industry is one of the most affected. Many countries around the world have imposed travel restrictions, so the number of flights around the world has decreased significantly. In this article, I will analyze and visualize flight data of some airports.
